## 1. System Description
Taking quality notes can be difficult when trying to keep up with lectures or work meetings while using unnecessarily complex note-taking apps. For anyone who wants to take quality notes while staying engaged in a conversation or
lecture, Lumberjack Notes is a free application that helps students and professionals enhance their note-taking ability by providing a more accessible way to organize and share ideas. Most note-taking apps are unnecessarily complex and hinder student/professional performance. Unlike other famous note-taking apps like Evernote, our app will be focused on simplicity, accessibility and mobile-centered performance.

Lumberjack Notes users can download the free application from the Google Play Store. Users will have the ability to use the sign in feature of the app by using an existing user profile; or they will have the option to create a new account, where they can fill in their personal details. Once signed-in, users will have the option to go through a simple
tutorial which will present them with relevant information about how the application functions. If the user decides to participate in the tutorial, they will learn how to take notes and use the various note-taking tools, such as organization tools. The user may customize their workspace with the tools that they will use the most and save them to their user preferences. Users could then use the save feature to store their work locally or to a cloud database. Finally, the app will offer the share feature to share their notes with their colleagues through the group management features.
