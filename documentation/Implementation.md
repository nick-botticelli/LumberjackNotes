## 1. Introduction

Lumberjack Notes is a free note-taking application designed to help students and professionals collaborate and share
their notes with their colleagues. Our application aims to provide a user-friendly interface with an intuitive
note-taking environment. Users of Lumberjack Notes will have the ability to customize and modify their workspace to fit
their needs. Users will also have the option to share their notes with fellow students or colleagues.

    - Estimated Hours: 8

## 3. Adopted technologies

**Android Studio**

The team used the Android Studio IDE to develop Lumberjack Notes. This application is designed specifically for implementing android code and it provides us with an environment to test our Android programs.

**Amazon Web Services**

Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts our server infrastructure to support the Lumberjack Notes app. AWS provides many
flexible tools and services like DynamoDB to allow for cloud-based functionality for our app.

**DynamoDB**

DynamoDB is an Amazon web service that uses NoSQL to manage Lumberjack Notes’ database. This gives our project
advantages, such as a built-in security service, and back-up and restore options.

## 4. Learning/Training

Our team’s learning strategy is to divide research topics among group members and build a basic “Hello World”
proof-of-concept application using Android Studio to familiarize ourselves with the process of constructing an Android
application. Knowing the basic functions of the IDE will help prepare us for development of the project. Certain group
members researched Cloud-based services and presented their findings to the team. This allowed us to gain a general
understanding of the client-server architecture in Lumberjack Notes.
