## 3. Adopted technologies

**Android Studio**
The team used the Android Studio IDE to develop Lumberjack Notes. This application is designed specifically for implementing android code and it provides us with an environment to test our Android programs.

**Amazon Web Services**
Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts our server infrastructure to support the Lumberjack Notes app. AWS provides many
flexible tools and services like DynamoDB to allow for cloud-based functionality for our app.

**DynamoDB**
DynamoDB is an Amazon web service that uses NoSQL to manage Lumberjack Notes’ database. This gives our project
advantages, such as a built-in security service, and back-up and restore options.
