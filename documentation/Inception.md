**Representative Quotes**
- “The app should have a draw-to shape feature. As a Biology major, I often need to draw diagrams and having this feature would make my notes a lot cleaner.”
- “I like when there is an option to choose between a light mode and dark mode. For certain assignments I need to turn in, it looks cleaner when I annotate documents in different lighting modes.”
